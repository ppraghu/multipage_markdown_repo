## Declarations

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and
member variables.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

__BAD:__

```java
String username, twitterHandle;
```

__GOOD:__

```java
String username;
String twitterHandle;
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where
scoping appropriate.


### Enum Classes

Enum classes should be avoided where possible, due to a large memory overhead.
Static constants are preferred. See http://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html#Overhead
for further details.

Enum classes without methods may be formatted without line-breaks, as follows:

```java
private enum CompassDirection { EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH }
```
