# Coding Standards Documentation

Well written software offers many advantages.  It will contain fewer bugs and will run more efficiently than poorly written programs. Good quality requires consistent efforts and focus from the software development team to meet quality goals. 

Our organization has developed General Standards and Guidelines as well as Language-specific Standards and Guidelines to ensure that developers follow widely accepted software development practices when coding.

***This page serves as the home page for all coding standards published in our organization for the use of software developers and architects.***

These coding standards are organized in such a way that:
- Each section in the coding standards documents is managed as an individual document, and can be edited/published by an authorized author
- At rendering time, the technical documentation with the newly modified version of the section will render to the end user.
